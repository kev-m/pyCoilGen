The **pyCoilGen** project is a community-based tool for the generation of [gradient field coil](https://mriquestions.com/gradient-coils.html) layouts within the
[MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) and [NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance) environments. **pyCoilGen** is based on a boundary element method and generates interconnected non-overlapping wire-tracks on 3D support structures. 

This Python project is a port of the MATLAB [CoilGen code](https://github.com/Philipp-MR/CoilGen) developed by Philipp Amrein. 

For detailed documentation, refer to the [pyCoilGen Documentation](https://pycoilgen.readthedocs.io/).

## Installation

Refer to the [Installation Guide](https://pycoilgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for detailed instructions on how to install and set up **pyCoilGen**.

## Examples

The [`examples`](https://github.com/kev-m/pyCoilGen/blob/master/examples) directory contains several examples for how to use **pyCoilGen**. These examples demonstrate different scenarios and configurations for generating coil layouts.

## Acknowledgements

The porting of the code from MATLAB to Python was facilitated by [ChatGPT, May 24 through August 3 Version](https://chat.openai.com) with manual corrections. 

Additional cross-checking was done using [MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html) provided by MathWorks.
