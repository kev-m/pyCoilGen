# pyCoilGen

**pyCoilGen** is a Python conversion of the [CoilGen MatLab project](https://github.com/Philipp-MR/CoilGen) application for generating gradient field coil layouts within the MRI/NMR environment. 

The tool is based on a boundary element method and creates interconnected, non-overlapping wire-tracks on 3D support structures.

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [pyCoilGen Documentation](https://github.com/kev-m/pyCoilGen/docs/index.md).

## Installation

Please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/kev-m/pyCoilGen/docs/installation.md) for detailed instructions on how to install and set up pyCoilGen.

## Examples

The [`examples`](https://github.com/kev-m/pyCoilGen/examples) directory contains several usage examples for pyCoilGen. These examples demonstrate different scenarios and configurations for generating coil layouts.

## Acknowledgements

This conversion from MatLab to Python was facilitated using [ChatGPT, May 24 through August 3 Version](https://chat.openai.com) with manual corrections. 

Additional cross-checking was done using the [online MATLAB](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) provided by MathWorks.
